PUBLIC AFFAIRS 
OFFICE OF THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF DEFENSE 1400 DEFENSE PENTAGON WASHINGTON, DC 2030 1-1 400 
OCT 0 8 2014 
MEMORANDUM FOR CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF CHIEFS OF THE MILITARY SERVICES COMMANDERS OF THE COMBATANT COMMANDS CHIEF OF THE NATIONAL GUARD BUREAU 
SUBJECT: Department of Defense Community Outreach in Local Areas for Fiscal Year 2015 
The purpose of this memorandum is to provide guidance regarding public affairs community outreach in local areas. Commanders are encouraged to engage in and support local community outreach efforts with speakers, musical units, ceremonial assets, unit formations, and ground equipment static displays. Aerial demonstrations, civic leader travel using aircraft, and aircraft static displays must be included and identified in the FY15 DoD Strategic Public Affairs Outreach Plan. 
The DoD's community outreach goal is to optimize the number of community events across a wide geographical radius and maximize impact. Therefore, DoD encourages support for local events that remain at low cost to the Government. 
Commanders are authorized to support local community outreach efforts at a cost up to $5,000 per single event without seeking an exception to policy for events not included in the FY15 DoD Strategic Public Affairs Outreach Plan, unless required otherwise by OASD(PA)/CPO. Costs may include, but are not limited to, fuel, mileage, temporary duty (TDY) personnel costs, government vehicles transporting static displays, and artillery round expenses. Subject to applicable regulations and policies, commanders may authorize local area use of government vehicles to transport individuals (such as community leaders or service members) who are part of an approved local community engagement program, supporting a military public affairs objective. Report these events to the Office of the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, Community and Public Outreach Division (OASD(PA)/CPO) through public affairs command channels to allow accurate communication of joint community outreach efforts to DoD leadership. All other support for community outreach events that require the expenditure of Component funds, excluding non-TDY personnel costs, should be executed within the Military Service guidelines that are captured in the FY15 DoD Strategic Public Affairs Outreach Plan. 
The precise definition of a local area is determined by the commander and dependent on the geographic layout of an installation. But, as a general guideline for the purpose of FY15 community outreach, a local area may be considered to be within 150-miles of an installation (to include ports of visit) or any travel that can be completed to and from in a single business day. This guidance includes activities near U.S. military installations in the continental United States, the U.S. territories, and outside of the continental United States. A request for an exception to policy should be submitted for community outreach activities beyond this mileage radius that are not captured in the FY15 DoD Strategic Public Affairs Outreach Plan but would require the expenditure of
